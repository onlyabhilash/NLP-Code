Please note that the code repository is still under development and review.
All the notebooks will be crystalized in the coming months.

1. Most notebooks are python >= 3.5 Some arenotebook are python < 3.5, this maily becuase one or more packages used in it dont have >=3.5 equivalent. All those will be highlighted explicitly
2. We have not covered hyper-parameter tunning in the notebooks
3. Though most notebooks are ready, its a still a work in progress.
4. For tensorflow, we have used  1.0 version 1.0. We are in the process of migrating them to the latesest tensorflow version
