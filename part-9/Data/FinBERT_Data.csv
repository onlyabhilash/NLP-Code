The good = everyone had similar models. The bad = poor US economy performance after 20 years of incredible returns.

Let me make it clear, Food delivery is not a major necessity for people to be paying super high premium for it. I would rather go get the food myself if it I have to pay close to 20$ on a delivery. I can cook or go eat out. The whole idea of monopolising the delivery market is impractical, any food company that beats your price can take you out anytime. And no body cares which company serves them. In the ride-sharing market, you care about the company for many legit reasons but not in food delivery. You care about cost. Added to that, if the economy slows down and people are layed off, consumer demand will slow down and revenue will go down. Meaning much fewer people will afford delivery fees.

Several weeks ago I figured it would crash to $500 by June 1, and after it dropped nearly $200 the first two days last week I thought it may get close. Of course it recovered about 40% of those losses, surging along with everything else in $SPY at Friday&#39;s close to end the day at $757. I do think $SHOP will still drop to below $500 within the short term, and $200 is still incredibly expensive while $100 is a bit more of a fair valuation. For some context Shopify is growing 1.75x faster than $AMZN and a share price of $200 would make them 2.5x more expensive using P/S.
